# Lautaro Jayat
Hi there!

I'm Lautaro Jayat. I like to learn and tinker with various technologies.

On this page, you'll find links to some projects and repositories I created while exploring tools, studying topics, or reading books.

As it might have happened to you as well, most of my coolest code is behind a non-disclosure agreement. But hey, I will try to keep writing free stuff here in my free time.

I hope you find it useful or at least interesting.

Feel free to drop me an email, open an issue, or send a pull request to say hello or share something üôÇ.
